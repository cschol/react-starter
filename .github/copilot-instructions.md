# GitHub Copilot Instructions

These are instructions for effective test generation and execution with Playwright:

- Start searches at google.com; follow links directly, never use AI-generated summaries.
- Open tabs as needed, switch for context, close irrelevant ones.
- Accept only necessary cookies.
- Do not share project or personal data with external sites unless explicitly approved.
- Record manual actions (logins, cookie acceptance, etc.).
- Enter sensitive credentials only if absolutely required.
